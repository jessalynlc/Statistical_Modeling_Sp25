## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Setup

```{r}
bird <- 14

bird
```

If you would like to create an outline with headings or modify text, you can also use the following notation to
do so:
• Use “#” in front of standard text to create headings. The more “#” symbols you use, the smaller the
headings.
• Use one set of * surrounding a word to make things italicized and two sets to make things bold.
• Lists may be created using either a dash symbol or and asterisk.

#Loading and Examining Data

```{r}
# Load necessary data.
crab_data <- read_csv(file=here("Labs/week2/pie_crab.csv"))
# Examine data structure.
str(crab_data)
```

#Tidy Data

```{r}
# Use the select() function to select column(s).
select(crab_data, air_temp)

# Use the filter() function to filter based on certain conditions.
filter(crab_data, water_temp > 20)

# Use the mutate() function to rename columns.
mutate(crab_data, air_water_diff = air_temp- water_temp)

# Create a new dataset called "crab_new".
# First, start with your original data and then...
crab_new <- crab_data %>%
# Create a new column with air and water temperatures multiplied and then...
mutate(airxwater = air_temp * water_temp) %>%
# Pull out (filter) entries for the Plum Island Ecosystem study only.
filter(site== "PIE")
# End of pipe.

crab_cool <- crab_data %>% 
  filter(water_temp < 18) %>% 
  select(site, size)
```

#Plot Data

```{r}
ggplot(data = crab_data, aes(x=site, y=size, fill = site)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x="Site Location",
       y = "Size (mm)") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
# You can see a list of all the 657 base colors R oﬀers by running colors() in your console.
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = crab_data, aes(x = site, y = size,
fill = site)) + # create base plot
geom_boxplot() + # add boxplots
labs(x = "Site Location",
y = "Size (mm)") + # add labels
scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + # specify values are discrete
theme_bw() + # remove gray background
theme(legend.position = "none") # remove legend
```
